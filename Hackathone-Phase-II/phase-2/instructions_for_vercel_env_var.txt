Hello! I've identified the issue with your backend not running on Vercel.

Your frontend Next.js application expects an environment variable named `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL` to know where your backend (Hugging Face app) is located. This variable was not set in your Vercel deployment, causing the frontend to look for the backend at a default local address.

To fix this, please follow these steps:

1.  **Go to your Vercel project dashboard:** Log in to Vercel and navigate to the project corresponding to your `frontend` deployment (it should be named `frontend` or similar).
2.  **Navigate to Project Settings:** Click on the "Settings" tab for your project.
3.  **Go to Environment Variables:** In the sidebar, click on "Environment Variables".
4.  **Add a New Environment Variable:**
    *   **Name:** `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL`
    *   **Value:** This should be the full URL of your Hugging Face backend application. For example, if your Hugging Face space is `https://huggingface.co/spaces/your-username/your-app`, then your API base URL might be `https://your-app.hf.space/api` or `https://huggingface.co/spaces/your-username/your-app/api`, depending on how your Hugging Face app exposes its API. **Please ensure you use the correct and complete URL for your Hugging Face backend API.**
    *   **Environments:** Make sure to select at least "Production" and "Preview". You can also select "Development" if you want this variable to be available when you test locally using the Vercel CLI.
5.  **Save Changes:** Click "Save" or "Add" to apply the new environment variable.
6.  **Redeploy your Project:** After saving the environment variable, you will need to trigger a new deployment for your Vercel frontend project. This will apply the new environment variable. You can usually do this from the "Deployments" tab by finding your last deployment and clicking "Redeploy", or by pushing a small change to your Git repository if you have Git integration set up.

Once these steps are completed and the project has redeployed, your frontend should be able to connect to your Hugging Face backend.

Please let me know if you encounter any issues or have questions about finding your Hugging Face backend URL!
