  Created comprehensive task list for the UI redesign with specific theme requirements with 56 specific tasks organized across 8 phases:

  1. Phase 1: Setup (3 tasks) - Environment preparation and backup
  2. Phase 2: Foundational Tasks (5 tasks) - Core infrastructure with strict color constraints
  3. Phase 3: User Story 1 (7 tasks) - Modern interface implementation
  4. Phase 4: User Story 2 (7 tasks) - Theme switching functionality with maroon/white and black/white only
  5. Phase 5: User Story 3 (7 tasks) - Front page redesign with structural improvements
  6. Phase 6: User Story 4 (10 tasks) - Chapter-specific layouts for 4 modules
  7. Phase 7: User Story 5 (7 tasks) - Component styling with modern design
  8. Phase 8: Polish & Cross-Cutting (10 tasks) - Quality assurance and validation

  All tasks follow the required checklist format with proper IDs, story labels, and file paths. Tasks are organized by user story priority (P1, P2, P3) and enable parallel execution where possible. The implementation strategy follows MVP-first approach focusing on core functionality before enhancements. All strict color constraints are incorporated into the tasks.
